# random-sequence-generator
My first little program
Goal: to generate random sequence for HPLC analyses

random-sequence-generator V.0.5 - 07/Nov/2020

Input: txt file with tab separated autosampler position.
The program randomize the positions and print out a csv file.
It asks you if you want to add washes to the sequence, how many replicates and after how many samples.

To improve in the future:
  -add the possibility to upload a sequence with more infos (method, sample name, injection volume, etc...)
  -upload excel and csv files
